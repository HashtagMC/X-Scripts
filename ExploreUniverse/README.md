# X-ExploreUniverse
A script for the game X², that adds a new command to let your ships explore the universe.
## Installation
Copy folders `scripts` and `t` into your X²: The Threat folder. If you're playing X² via Steam this will probably be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\X2 - The Threat\`.
## Activating the Script Editor
To use this script, you will have to activate the script editor. **Warning! This will mark your save with `modified`, and there's no way to undo this!**.

To activate the script editor type `Thereshallbewings` while flying. You might need some tries until the game recognizes it. If it works you will hear a beep sound.
## Setting the script up
Press `[Return]`, press `[E]` and select `Script Editor`. Select `Script Editor` again, scroll down (using arrow keys) until you find `setup.hmc.exploreuniverse`. Press `[R]`, press `[Return]` until the list appears again and you should be done.
## Ship Requirements
All Ships up to TP that are equipped with Navigation Software Mk I are able to use the script.
## Usage
Open the command menu of your ship, select `Navigation` and select `Explore Universe`. The ship will explore all unknown sectors it can reach without flying twice through a sector. **Warning! The ship will try to fly through Xenon Sectors too, what will probably result in its destruction.** When there's no sector left it can explore it'll send you a message listing all sectors it discovered.
