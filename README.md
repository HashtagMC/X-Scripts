# HBName
I wrote a small scripts that adds the homebase to a ships name:

[Homebase] Type

Example:

[Carrier 5] Argon Nova

## Requirements
* Smaller than M6 (+ no fighting drone)
* Special Software Mk1 installed

The command "Add homebase to name [HBName]" is in the "Special" command menu.

## Attention: In order to use this script, the scripteditor has to be activated. This will mark your save with **modified**!

The script is available in German and English, a readme is included.
