<t id="209">The ship this command is applied to explores unknown sectors without a pilot. It requires at least one unexplored sector to border the sector the ship is in. Whenever it discovers a sector it will randomly pick another unknown sector bordering the just discovered one. As soon as it reaches a sector not bordering any unexplored sectors it will finish its tour and transmit the count and names of all discovered sectors back to its owner. \n\n\033BCopyright Jazura 562 HashtagMC Software Company, \033BHome of Light, Argon Federation</t>
